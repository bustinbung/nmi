## Where to Start

### Never touched Svelte(kit)?

Start here, then move to src/routes/+page.svelte. I'll do my best to lead you from there.

### I have some experience.

You're on your own.

## Technologies

- [Svelte(Kit)](https://svelte.dev). UI and JS framework.
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/). Map library.

- [pbf](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf). Lightweight protobuffer library.

## Documentation

The code for this project is documented to the best of my ability. The internet is your friend for anything you don't understand. If a file isn't littered with comments, it was either: a) auto-generated or b) not worth documenting.

## Warning

This project will not be maintained after December 8th, 2024. Any large-scale issues or bugs that arise will not be fixed.
